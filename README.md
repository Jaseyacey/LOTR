# LOTRFACTS
A React Native App written in Javascript. 
This app uses the open source API from https://tolkien-api.herokuapp.com/index.html written by https://github.com/mudroljub

This is just a fun app I am playing around with. 

To run the app:
GIT clone https://github.com/Jaseyacey/LOTR.git

Then run this in your terminal: 
npm i && cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npm run ios

Enjoy the facts...
